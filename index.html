    <h1>The Basics of The Web and HTML</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <div class="notes">
        <p>The web is a collection of HTML documents. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is the main type of document on the web. The major pieces to the web start with us on our browser. The browser makes HTTP requests to the internet that goes to the server and the server sends back the web page you wish to browse through the internet.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="header"><h3>HTML is made up of:</h3>
      <div class="notes">
        <p>text content: what you see</p>
        <p>markup: what it looks like</p>
        <p>references to other documents: i.e..images and videos</p>
        <p>links to other pages: websites, compose email</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="header"><h3>HTML Tags:</h3>
      <div class="notes">
        <p>b = bold</p>
        <p>em = emphasis/italics</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="header"><h3>HTML Attributes:</h3>
      <div class="notes">
        <p>href: the value of an anchor tag that links the media to the html document.</p>
        <p>src: the value of an image tag that links the image to the html document.</p>
        <p>alt: the value of the alternate text displayed in the image tag if the image won't load.</p>
        <p>Image tags are called void tags since they don't have any content which is why they don;t require a closing tag.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="header"><h3>Whitespace:</h3>
      <div class="notes">
        <p>br = allows you to create a new line of text in html.</p>
        <p>p = allows you to create a paragraph of content in html.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="header"><h3>Inline and Block Elements</h3>
      <div class="notes">
        <p>A, span, br, img, and strong are all inline elements because they don't generate a box around the content like a block elements does when you use p, div, or form.</p>  
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="title"><h1>Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <div class="notes">
        <p>HTML is the standard markup language used to create webpages.</p>
        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is the language for how the page looks and is styled.</p>
        <p>DOM stands for Document Object Model. DOM is a cross-platform and language independent convention for representing and interacting with the elements in HTML. DOM gives the elements in HTML the tree like structure.</p>
      </div>

  <div class="title"><h1>Adding Style to Structure with CSS</h1>
    <div class="header"><h3>More About CSS</h3>
      <div class="notes">
        <p>CSS are rules for an HTML document to abide by that changes the format and style of all the elements in the page.</p>
        <p>Selectors in the CSS are how you can change the rules to a specific element in a webpage.</p>
        <p>A declaration is a line of code that controls the "background-color"(property) and the color "black"(value of that property).</p>
        <p>Adding a class selector allows you to be more specific when dealing with multiple elements that are the same and want to style them separately.</p>
        <p>To add a CSS style page to your html document you have to reference it in the head of your webpage.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="header"><h3>Avoiding Repitition</h3>
      <div class="notes">
        <p>The awesome advantage to CSS with HTML is eliminating repitition. No matter how often an element appears throughout your website. If the CSS declares a rule to that specific element, it will look the same throughout all the html pages that link to the CSS page. Making the programmer's life easier.</p>

  <div class="title"><h1>Serious Programming</h1>
    <div class="header"><h3>Computers</h3>
      <div class="notes">
        <p>Computers can be programmed to do anything we want as long as we can correctly write out the program telling it what to do.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="header"><h3>Programs</h3>
      <div class="notes">
        <p>A program is a specific number of steps the computer can follow to do as requested. Games, websites, simple apps are examples of programs.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="header"><h3>Python</h3>
      <div class="notes">
        <p>Python is a programming language that programmers can use to tell a computer what to do. When python code is ran it interprets the code and makes it a list of instructions the computer can follow.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="header"><h3>Grammar</h3>
      <div class="notes">
        <p>Now grammar in programming isn't the same as we would think. However, programming does have its correct and incorrect situations. We have to be exactly correct for a computer to understand what we want otherwise it won't run at all.</p>
      </div>

  <div class="title"><h1>Variables and Strings</h1>
    <div class="header"><h3>Variables</h3>
      <div class="notes">
        <p>A way for programmers to give names for values in python.</p>
        <p>Assigning variables is simple. To assign the value Anthony to the variable my_name the code looks like this: 
         <br> <p>my_name = 'Anthony'</p>
        It is important that you think of the equal sign as "is the same as" and not an equal sign like in arithmetic. Variables are useful because it allows programmers to make the data easier to read and understand. Another important fact is using quotation marks around a number makes it a string instead of an integer. This changes the outcome of the code you are inputting and gives a completely different answer.</p>

  <div class="title"><h1>Input, Function and Output</h1>
    <div class="header"><h3>What is a Function?</h3>
      <div class="notes">
        <p>A function is something that takes input, does something to that input, then produces as output.</p>
        <p>It is important to know what makes and uses a function to understand the code. Starting the line of code with def and giving specific parameters are what makes the function. Then the line of code that uses(calls) the function replaces the values that are using it.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="header"><h3>Avoiding Repitition</h3>
      <div class="notes">
        <p>Repitition is greatly decreased since once you have defined a function it can be reused over and over in the program. However, make sure you never forget your return statement. Forgetting this will cause the code not to know what it should produce and the print command will return with none.</p>

  <div class="title"><h1>Control Flow and Loops</h1>
    <div class="header"><h3>Procedural Thinking</h3>
      <div class="notes">
        <p>Decision making and repitition are two very important tools in procedural thinking. Executing well on these allows you to become a very great programmer.</p>
        <p>If statements control which code gets executed when; while loops control the code to perform the same task many times till it is specifically told to stop.</p>

  <div class="title"><h1>Debugging</h1>
    <div class="header"><h3>Debugging Strategy</h3>
      <div class="notes">
        <p>Having a strategy when it comes to debugging is not only important but the only way you can keep frustration out of the picture when it comes up. You have to accept that errors happen and have a routine to fix them quick.</p>
        <p><b>Step 1: Examine error messages when programs crash.</b></p>
        <p>The last line of tracebacks will tell you where the error occurred. Read backwards till you find it.</p>
        <p><b>Step 2: Work from example code.</b></p>
        <p>If your proof read code doesn't work, comment that section out and do a step-by-step test to the code till it does what you want.</p>
        <p><b>Step 3: Make sure examples work.</b></p>
        <p>Always check the example code to see if it works in your system since that might not always be correct.<p>
        <p><b>Step 4: Print intermediate results.</b></p>
        <p>If your code doesn't crash and you don't get what you expected, add print statements to your program to find the misbehaving code.</p>
        <p><b>Step 5: Keep and compare old versions.</b></p>
        <p>Always find a good checkpoint to save your code elsewhere before attempting more so you can go back to it if you have too many errors.</p>

  <div class="title"><h1>Lists and For Loops</h1>
    <div class="header"><h3>Lists</h3>
      <div class="notes">
        <p>List - An very useful way to store data in a structured object.</p>
        <p>Nested Lists - A list or multiple lists inside of one another.</p>
        <p>Mutation - We can change the value of a list after we have created it.</p>
        <p>Aliasing - Two different ways to refer to the same object.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="header"><h3>List Operations</h3>
      <div class="notes">
        <p>Append - Adding an element to the end of a list. "list.append(element)"</p>
        <p>Plus - Produces a new list of the two lists together.</p>
        <p>Len - Takes and inputs the list and outputs the number of elements in the list.</p>
        <p>For Loops - This tests all elements in a list to the block code.</p>
        <p>Index - If the value is in the list, the first position found will be returned.</p>
        <p>In - True/False result of a value found or not found in a list.</p>
